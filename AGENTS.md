# pi-idle-time

Pi extension that injects per-message timing context into every user prompt,
making the AI aware of wall-clock time, idle duration, and previous turn
execution time. Integrates with the pi-statusline extension.

## Architecture

This is a **pi extension** (see [pi.dev](https://pi.dev)) distributed as an npm
package. The extension hooks into pi's lifecycle events:

- `input` — on user prompt, inject timing context and optional idle system message
- `agent_end` — when the LLM finishes, record stop timestamps and turn duration
- `session_before_compact` — reset idle timer on context compaction

### Module Layout

```
src/
  index.ts                       — Pi extension entry point (lifecycle hooks, statusline, commands, heartbeat)
  heartbeat.ts                   — Idle heartbeat timer for cache keepalive
  heartbeat-tool-renderer.ts     — Compact renderer for the heartbeat control tool
  heartbeat-message-renderer.ts  — Compact renderer for [cache keepalive] deliverable
  goal.ts                        — Idle goal reminder message formatting
  goal-message-renderer.ts       — Compact renderer for [goal reminder] deliverable
  time.ts                        — ISO timestamp utilities
  duration.ts                    — Elapsed time formatting for statusline
  format.ts                      — Timing block and idle system message formatting
  sanitize.ts                    — Session ID sanitization
  config.ts                      — Config loading with validation and defaults
  log.ts                         — Per-session NDJSON error logger
  last-response.ts               — Flat .lastresponse file for fast statusline reads
  state.ts                       — Per-session state persistence with atomic writes
```

### Statusline Integration

Uses `ctx.ui.setStatus("idle-time", text)` to display elapsed time since the
model last responded. This integrates with `@narumitw/pi-statusline` which reads
extension statuses via `getExtensionStatuses()`.

### Configuration

Stored in `${dataDir}/config.json` with these keys:

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `idleMessageThresholdSeconds` | 10 | Min idle gap before visible system message |
| `idleMessageDropSecondsAfterSeconds` | 3600 | Drop trailing seconds in system message after this |
| `dropSecondsAfterSeconds` | 900 | Statusline drops seconds after this (15 min) |
| `formatHoursAsDays` | true | Format `[after 1d 4h]` instead of `[after 28h 0m]` |
| `idleHeartbeatMinutes` | `null` | Default heartbeat interval in minutes; `null` disables |
| `idleHeartbeatMessage` | `[cache keepalive] {time} — disable via idle_time_heartbeat_control tool.` | Keepalive message template; `{time}` is replaced with current local `HH:MM:SS` |

### State Persistence

Per-session state is stored in `${dataDir}/sessions/<sessionId>.json`. The state
module provides atomic file writes with temp-file rename and stale tmp sweep.
Since pi extensions run in a single process, the in-process mutex serializes
concurrent operations without needing cross-process file locks. Persisted state
includes the active idle goal, goal-created timestamp, and any per-session
heartbeat/goal interval overrides.

### Commands

- `/idle-time-reset` — Clear state for current session (or all with `--all --yes`)
- `/idle-time-status` — Self-test: check data dir, state, config
- `/idle-time-config` — Show current configuration
- `/idle-time-heartbeat` — Toggle the cache keepalive heartbeat
- `/idle-goal <description>` — Set an idle goal reminder
- `/idle-goal` / `/idle-goal --status` — Show the active goal
- `/idle-goal --complete` — Mark the active goal complete

### Cache Keepalive Heartbeat

`idle_time_heartbeat_control` is an LLM-callable tool that enables or disables
an idle heartbeat for the current session. When enabled, after the configured
number of minutes of inactivity the extension sends a short user message
(`idleHeartbeatMessage`, with `{time}` replaced by the current time). This
triggers a real assistant turn, refreshing the Anthropic prompt cache.

The heartbeat is **opt-in and disabled by default** because each firing consumes
tokens and produces a visible chat message. The agent can toggle it during a
session; the enabled state persists per session in the state file.

### Idle Goal Reminders

`/idle-goal <description>` sets a per-session idle goal. After the configured
`idleHeartbeatMinutes` of inactivity, a reminder message is sent to the LLM:

```text
[goal reminder] HH:MM:SS
<description>

<system-reminder>Use idle_time_heartbeat_control with completeGoal=true only when the underlying task is actually finished. Idle does not mean done, and receiving this reminder does not mean the goal is complete. If work is still in progress, leave the goal active and continue working or send a status update.</system-reminder>
```

The user sees a compact TUI render (`🎯 idle goal · <preview> · <time> · <interval>`);
the LLM sees the full block above. Goal reminders take precedence over the
keepalive heartbeat while a goal is active. The agent can set or complete goals
via the `goal` and `completeGoal` parameters on `idle_time_heartbeat_control`.
The active goal persists per session in the state file.

A `minutes` override provided when setting a goal is remembered for that goal,
and a `minutes` override provided when enabling the heartbeat is remembered for
the heartbeat. `enabled` is now optional when the tool call only changes the
goal, and goal reminders run regardless of `enabled` while a goal is active.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm check    # typecheck
```

## Testing

Tests use `node:test` (Node.js built-in test runner). The test suite covers:
- All utility modules (time, duration, format, sanitize, config, log, last-response, state)
- Integration tests for full prompt→stop→prompt sequences
- Concurrent state mutation safety
- Error handling and edge cases
